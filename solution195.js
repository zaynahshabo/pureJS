// Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
// Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.
// Example 1:
// Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
// Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
// Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
// Example 2:
// Input: arr = [1,2,3]
// Output: [1,2,3]
// Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 104
// 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
//receive array of integers which may or may not contain 0
//duplicate each instance of 0, maintaining original array length and leaving off any overflowing values. do not return any values.
//for loop through original array, if 0 is found,
